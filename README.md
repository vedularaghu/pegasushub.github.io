# PegasusHub

A Community-enabled Workflows Repository for Pegasus

### Adding your own workflow repository

In order to add your own Pegasus-enabled workflow repository, 
you only need to add your organization and repository names 
to the `_data/workflows.yml` file as follows:

```
- organization: my-github-organization
  repo_name: my-workflow-repository
```

The preferred way to submit your changes is via creating a 
**pull request** with the changes.
